          <h3>Interests</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy gaming and watching movies. Some of my favorite games are
            Horizon Zero Dawn, Astroneer, Pok√©mon Shield and most Legend of Zelda
            games. I love traveling/exploring new places, hiking, puns (they are
            intended) and coffee shops. Recently, I've been dedicating most of my
            time to strengthening my programming skills, but lucky for me, I
            really like coding, too!
